# VeritasAI

VeritasAI is a powerful, AI-driven platform designed for educational integrity. It provides both students and educators with advanced tools to detect AI-generated content and check for plagiarism, while also offering personalized feedback to help improve writing skills.

## Project Overview

The application is built as a modern web app with separate dashboards for two primary roles:

*   **Student Dashboard**: A portal for students to submit their assignments, view detailed analysis reports on their work, receive constructive feedback, and track their writing progress over time.
*   **Teacher Dashboard**: A comprehensive view for educators to create and manage assignments, review all student submissions, and quickly identify potential instances of academic dishonesty through an intelligent flagging system.

## Core Features

*   **AI Content Detection**: Leverages advanced AI models to analyze text and determine the likelihood of it being AI-generated. It provides a percentage score and highlights specific sections that are suspect.
*   **Internal Plagiarism Checking**: Compares a student's submission against the work of their peers for the same assignment to identify textual similarities and potential collaboration issues.
*   **Personalized Feedback Generation**: The AI analyzes the submission and provides constructive feedback on its strengths and weaknesses, suggesting areas for improvement.
*   **Submission Portal**: Students can easily paste or upload their work for analysis.
*   **Writing Profile**: A persistent profile for each student that tracks their submission history and AI-likelihood scores over time.
*   **Teacher Flagging System**: Automatically flags submissions with high AI or plagiarism scores on the teacher's dashboard for easy review.

## Tech Stack

VeritasAI is built with a modern, robust, and scalable technology stack:

*   **Framework**: Next.js (with App Router)
*   **Language**: TypeScript
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
*   **UI Components**: ShadCN UI
